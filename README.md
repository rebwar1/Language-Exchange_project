Language Exchange Website
Business problem
At CodeYourFuture, we are trying to improve our language education through fun, regular community activities.
We would benefit from a centralised system that can handle these activities, mainly the ability for people to find language partners to exchange and practice languages with. Our volunteer pool could potentially expand to recruit language buddies who solely want to help practice languages.
Proposed functionality

The website should allow users to search for other users who are signed up with the aim of establishing a language exchange. This search functionality should offer a way to contact the user of their choice.

Upcoming language events should be visible on the homepage

A page with resources for English learning and other language learning should exist

Users should be able to create an account. These accounts should be publicly accessible on a path on the website e.g. cyf-languages/august but individual infrmation cannot be accessed without authentication.

All data should be stored in a database using an API to interface with it.
Users and roles

As a user, I want to be able to create an account that will hold all data about me as a potential language partner - languages I speak, languages I want to learn, availability, timezone, and topics of interest

As a user, I want to be able to contact potential language partners. This may be through the website itself or potentially via a platform like Slack

As a user, I want to be able to see upcoming events and show my interest in attending

As an admin, I want to be able to update content on the site to keep it current and relevant e.g. upcoming events, resources

Likely challenges
Be careful how you structure your data as this could get confusing quickly
Integration with Slack may prove difficult. Think about whether there is a way for users to interact before moving to Slack.
Stretch goals
User Research
Speak to potential users about what features theyâ€™d like to use. Select a sensible feature and build it.
Speak to people who have been a part of the language project as organizers and learners to discuss what issues have been faced. Think about features that might start to solve these problems.

Dark mode / toggling modes (accessibility)
As any kind of user, I would like to be able to toggle my preference to use dark mode
If possible, as a user, I would like other options for the colours used on the background and text

Creating a non-formal educational platform with the goals you have outlined can be a challenging and rewarding endeavor. Here are some steps to consider in creating such a platform:
Define your target audience: Determine the age range, education level, and interests of the young people you want to reach.
Choose a format for your platform: Will it be an online platform, a physical space, or a combination of both? Think about the resources you have available, and what will be most effective for reaching your target audience.
Develop a curriculum: Determine what topics you want to cover and how you want to deliver the content. Consider the best way to make the material engaging and interactive, so that young people can apply theoretical knowledge in practice and express their opinions freely.
Recruit volunteers: Identify individuals who can help with teaching, facilitating discussions, and organizing events. Look for people with a variety of skills and experiences who can bring different perspectives to the platform.
Establish partnerships: Collaborate with other non-governmental organizations, movements, and state structures to achieve common goals. Reach out to other international NGOs to support the establishment and strengthening of ties between Armenian and foreign youth.
Create a marketing plan: Promote your platform to young people and the community at large. Utilize social media, traditional advertising, and word of mouth to spread the word about your platform.
Evaluate and adjust: Continually monitor the success of your platform, gather feedback from young people, and make adjustments as needed to ensure that you are meeting your goals.
Some websites that may be helpful in creating a non-formal educational platform for young people include:
YouthActionNet.org: A global network that provides resources and training for young leaders.
Edutopia.org: A website that offers innovative teaching strategies and resources for educators.
Coursera.org: An online platform that offers courses on a wide range of subjects, including education and leadership.
Youth.gov: A government website that offers resources for youth programs and policy development.
Unicef.org: The United Nations Children's Fund provides resources for promoting youth development and education.
